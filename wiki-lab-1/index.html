            (also

            <i>canopy shyness,</i>

            ) is a feature observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, instead forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> This is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different species.<sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches leads to "
reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees. Trees in windy 
areas suffer physical damage as they collide 
with each other during winds. 
The abrasions and collisions 
induce a crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral 
branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.[10] If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.[11] This explains instances of crown shyness between branches of the same organism. 
Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession forests where branches are 
flexible and limited in lateral movement.[
<sup></sup>6][12] According to this theory, variable flexibility in lateral branches greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.

<sup></sup>Similarly, some research suggests that constant abrasion at growth 
nodules disrupts bud tissue such 
that it is unable to continue with 
lateral growth. Australian forester M.R. Jacobs, 
who studied the crown shyness patterns 
in eucalyptus in 1955, believed 
that the trees' growing tips were 
sensitive to abrasion, resulting 
in canopy gaps.[13] Miguel Franco 
(1986) observed that the branches 
of Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce) and 
Larix kaempferi (Japanese larch) suffered 
physical damage due to abrasion, 
<sup></sup>which killed the leading shoots.
