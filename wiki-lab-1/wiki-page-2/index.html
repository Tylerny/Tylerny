<sup>Graphic design is a profession,
    [2] academic discipline[3]
    [4][5] and applied art whose 
    activity consists in projecting 
    visual communications intended to transmit 
    specific messages to social groups, 
    with specific objectives.[6] 
    Graphic design is an interdisciplinary 
    branch of design[1] and of the fine arts. 
    Its practice involves creativity, 
    innovation and lateral thinking using 
    manual or digital tools, where 
    it is usual to use text and graphics to 
    <sup>communicate visually.

 <sup>The role of the graphic designer 
    in the communication process 
    is that of encoder or interpreter 
    of the message. 
    They work on the interpretation, 
    ordering, and presentation 
    of visual messages. 
    Usually, graphic design uses 
    the aesthetics of typography 
    and the compositional arrangement 
    of the text, ornamentation, 
    <sup></sup>and imagery to convey ideas, 
    feelings, and attitudes beyond 
    what language alone expresses. 
    The design work can be based on a 
    customer's demand, a demand 
    that ends up being established 
    linguistically, either orally or in 
    writing, that is, that graphic design 
    transforms a linguistic message 
    <sup></sup>into a graphic manifestation.

    <sup></sup>Graphic design has, as a field of 
    application, different areas of 
    knowledge focused on any visual 
    communication system. For example, 
    it can be applied in advertising 
    strategies, or it can also be 
    applied in the aviation world[8] 
    or space exploration.[9][10] In this 
    sense, in some countries graphic 
    design is related as only 
    associated with the production of 
    sketches and drawings, this is 
    incorrect, since visual 
    communication is a small part of 
    a huge range of types and 
    <sup></sup>classes where it can be applied.

        <sup></sup>With origins in Antiquity and 
        the Middle Ages,[11] graphic 
        design as applied art was 
        initially linked to the boom 
        of rise of printing in Europe 
        in the 15th century and the 
        growth of consumer culture in 
        the Industrial Revolution. 
        From there it emerged as a 
        <sup></sup>distinct profession in the 
        West, closely associated 
        with advertising in the 
        19th century[12] and its 
        evolution allowed its 
        consolidation in the 
        20th century. 
        Given the rapid and massive 
        growth in information exchange 
        today, the demand for experienced 
        designers is greater than ever, 
        particularly because of the development 
        of new technologies and the need 
        to pay attention to human factors 
        beyond the competence of the 
        <sup></sup>engineers 
        who develop them.

            <sup></sup>William Addison Dwiggins 
            is often credited with 
            first using the term 
            "graphic design" in a 
            1922 article,[14] although 
            it appears in a 4 July 1908 
            issue (volume 9, number 27) 
            of Organized Labor, a 
            publication of the Labor 
            Unions of San Francisco, 
            in an article about 
            technical education for 
            <sup></sup>printers:[15]

            An Enterprising Trades Union
            … The admittedly high 
            standard of intelligence 
            which prevails among 
            printers is an assurance 
            that with the elemental 
            principles of design at 
            their finger ends many of 
            them will grow in knowledge 
            and develop into specialists in 
            <sup>graphic design and decorating. …
            
            <sup>A decade later, the 
            1917–1918 course catalog 
            of the California School 
            of Arts & Crafts 
            advertised a course 
            titled Graphic Design and 
            Lettering, which replaced 
            one called Advanced 
            Design and Lettering. 
            Both classes were taught 
            <sup></sup>by Frederick Meyer.

                In China, during the Tang dynasty

                print on textiles and later to 
                reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist 
                scripture printed in 868 is the
